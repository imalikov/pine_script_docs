Context switching and the security function
===========================================

.. contents:: :local:
    :depth: 2

The ``security`` function enables scripts to request data from
symbols and/or resolutions other than the ones a script is running on.

Let's assume the following script is running on an IBM chart at *1 minute*. It
will display the *close* price of the IBM symbol, but at *15 minutes* resolution.

::

    //@version=4
    study("Example security 1", overlay=true)
    ibm_15 = security("NYSE:IBM", "15", close)
    plot(ibm_15)

The `security <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_security>`__
function's first argument is the name of the requested symbol. The second
argument is the required resolution and the third one is an expression
which will be calculated on the requested series *within* the ``security`` call.

The name of the symbol can be defined using two variants: with a prefix that
contains the exchange (or data provider), or without it. For example:
``"NYSE:IBM"``, ``"BATS:IBM"`` or ``"IBM"``. When an exchange is not provided,
BATS will be used as the default. The current symbol name is stored in the
`syminfo.ticker <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_syminfo{dot}ticker>`__ and
`syminfo.tickerid <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_syminfo{dot}tickerid>`__
built-in variables. ``syminfo.ticker`` contains the value of the
symbol name without its exchange prefix, for example ``"MSFT"``.
``syminfo.tickerid`` contains the value of the symbol name with its exchange prefix, for example,
``"BATS:MSFT"`` or ``"NASDAQ:MSFT"``. It is recommended to use ``syminfo.tickerid`` to avoid
ambiguity in the values returned by ``security``.

The second argument of the ``security`` function, ``resolution`` (i.e., the *timeframe*), is
also a string. All intraday resolutions are defined using a
number of minutes. The lowest resolution is *one minute* and is indicated by the
literal ``"1"``. It is possible to request any [#minutes]_ number of minutes: ``"5"``, ``"10"``,
``"21"``, etc. *Hourly* resolution is also set by minutes [#hours]_. For example, the
following lines signify one hour, two hours and four hours respectively:
``"60"``, ``"120"``, ``"240"``. A resolution with a value of *1 day* is indicated by
``"D"`` or ``"1D"``. It is possible to request any number of days: ``"2D"``,
``"3D"``, etc. *Weekly* and *Monthly* resolutions are set in a similar way: ``"W"``,
``"1W"``, ``"2W"``, ..., ``"M"``, ``"1M"``, ``"2M"``. ``"M"`` and ``"1M"`` denote the same monthly
resolution, and ``"W"`` and ``"1W"`` the same weekly resolution. The
third parameter of the security function can be any arithmetic
expression or a function call, which will be calculated in the context of the chosen series.
The resolution of the main chart's symbol is stored in the
`timeframe.period <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_timeframe{dot}period>`__
built-in variable.

With the ``security`` function, users can view a *1 minute* chart while
displaying an SMA (or any other expression) from any other resolution
(i.e., daily, weekly, monthly)::

    //@version=4
    study(title="High Time Frame MA", overlay=true)
    src = close, len = 9
    out = sma(src, len)
    out1 = security(syminfo.tickerid, 'D', out)
    plot(out1)

One can declare the following variable:

::

    spread = high - low

and calculate it at *1 minute*, *15 minutes* and *60 minutes*::

    spread_1 = security(tickerid, '1', spread)
    spread_15 = security(tickerid, '15', spread)
    spread_60 = security(tickerid, '60', spread)

The ``security`` function
returns a series which is then adapted to the time scale of
the current chart's symbol. This result can be either shown directly on
the chart (i.e., with ``plot``), or used in further calculations.
The "Advance Decline Ratio" script illustrates a more
involved use of ``security``::

    //@version=4
    study(title = "Advance Decline Ratio", shorttitle="ADR")
    ratio(t1, t2, source) =>
        s1 = security(t1, timeframe.period, source)
        s2 = security(t2, timeframe.period, source)
        s1 / s2
    plot(ratio("USI:ADVN.NY", "USI:DECL.NY", close))

The script requests two additional securities. The results of the
requests are then used in an arithmetic formula. As a result, we have a
stock market indicator used by investors to measure the number of
individual stocks participating in an upward or downward trend.



.. _barmerge_gaps_and_lookahead:

Barmerge gaps and lookahead
---------------------------

There are two switches that define how data requested with ``security``
will be mapped to the current timeframe.

The first one, ``gaps``, controls gaps in data. With the default value
`barmerge.gaps_off <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_barmerge{dot}gaps_off>`__, data is
merged continuously (without ``na`` gaps). All gaps, if any, are filled with the previous nearest non-``na`` value.
If `barmerge.gaps_on <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_barmerge{dot}gaps_on>`__
is used, then merged data may contain gaps in the form of ``na`` values.

The second switch, ``lookahead``, was added in :ref:`Pine Script version
3 <release_notes_v3>`. The parameter has two possible values:
`barmerge.lookahead_off <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_barmerge{dot}lookahead_off>`__
and
`barmerge.lookahead_on <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#var_barmerge{dot}lookahead_on>`__
to respectively switch between the new, default behavior of
`security <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_security>`__,
and the old behavior dating from Pine v1 and v2.

This example shows the difference on a *5 minutes* chart::

    //@version=4
    study('My Script', overlay=true)
    a = security(syminfo.tickerid, '60', low, lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
    plot(a, color=color.red)
    b = security(syminfo.tickerid, '60', low, lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_on)
    plot(b, color=color.lime)

.. image:: /appendix/images/V3.png

The green line on the chart is the *low* price of an hourly bar that is
requested with *lookahead on*. It's the old behavior of the security
function. The green line based on
historical data is displayed at the price level of an hourly *low* right
after a new hourly bar is created (dotted blue vertical lines).

The red line is a *low* price of an hourly bar that is requested with *lookahead
off*. In this case the requested *low* price of an hourly historical bar
will be given only on the last minute bar of the requested hour, when an
hourly bar's *low* won't return future data.

The fuchsia dotted line represents the beginning of real-time data. You can see that
``barmerge.lookahead_on`` and ``barmerge.lookahead_off`` behave the same way
on real-time data, i.e., as ``barmerge.lookahead_off`` does.

.. _understanding_lookahead:

Understanding lookahead
-----------------------

There are many published scripts using the following code::

    //@version=2
    //...
    a = security(tickerid, 'D', close[1]) // It's barmerge.lookahead_on, because version is 2

In this case the ``close[1]`` expression fetches the ``close`` of the
previous day, so the construction **does not use future data**.

In Pine v3 or later, we can rewrite this in two different ways, using
``barmerge.lookahead_on`` or ``barmerge.lookahead_off``. If you use
``barmerge.lookahead_on``, then it's quite simple::

    //@version=4
    //...
    a = security(syminfo.tickerid, 'D', close[1], lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_on)

Because the original construction doesn't use future data, it is
possible to rewrite it using ``barmerge.lookahead_off``. If you use
``barmerge.lookahead_off``, the script is more complex but shows
how the lookahead parameter works::

    //@version=4
    //...
    indexHighTF = barstate.isrealtime ? 1 : 0
    indexCurrTF = barstate.isrealtime ? 0 : 1
    a0 = security(syminfo.tickerid, 'D', close[indexHighTF], lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
    a = a0[indexCurrTF]

When an indicator is based on historical data (i.e.,
``barstate.isrealtime`` is ``false``), we take the current *close* of
the daily resolution and shift the result of ``security`` function call one bar to the
right in the current resolution. When an indicator is calculated on
real-time data, we take the *close* of the previous day without shifting the
``security`` data.



.. _requesting_data_of_a_lower_timeframe:

Requesting data of a lower timeframe
------------------------------------

``security`` function was designed to request data of a timeframe *higher*
than the current chart timeframe. On a *60 minutes* chart,
this would mean requesting 240, D, W, or any higher timeframe.

It is not recommended to request data of a timeframe *lower* that the current chart timeframe,
for example *1 minute* data from a *5 minutes* chart. The main problem with such a case is that
some part of a 1 minute data will be inevitably lost, as it's impossible to display it on a *5 minutes*
chart and not to break the time axis. In such cases the behavior of ``security`` can be rather unexpected.
The next example illustrates this::

    // Add this script on a "5" minute chart
    //@version=4
    study("Lookahead On/Off", overlay=true, precision=5)
    l_on = security(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close, lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_on)
    l_off = security(syminfo.tickerid, "1", close, lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
    plot(l_on, color=color.red)
    plot(l_off, color=color.blue)

.. image:: images/SecurityLowerTF_LookaheadOnOff.png

This study plots two lines which correspond to different values of the ``lookahead`` parameter.
The red line shows data returned by ``security`` with ``lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_on``. 
The blue line with ``lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off``. Let's look at the *5 minutes* bar starting at 07:50.
The red line at this bar has a value of 1.13151 which corresponds to the
value of *the first of the five 1 minute bars* that fall into the time range 07:50--07:54.
On the other hand, the blue line at the same bar has a value of 1.13121 which corresponds to
*the last of the five 1 minute bars* of the same time range.



.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#minutes] Actually the highest supported minute resolution is "1440" (which is the number of minutes in 24 hours).

.. [#hours] Requesting data of ``"1h"`` or ``"1H"`` resolution would result in an error. Use ``"60"`` instead.
