Expressions, declarations and statements
========================================

Expressions
-----------

An expression is a sequence where operators or function
calls are applied to operands (variables or values) to define the calculations
and actions required by the script. Expressions in Pine almost always
produce a result (exceptions are the functions
``study``, ``fill``, ``strategy.entry``, etc., which produce side effects and will be covered
later).

Here are some examples of simple expressions::

    (high + low + close)/3
    sma(high - low, 10) + sma(close, 20)

.. _variable_declaration:

Variable declaration
--------------------

Variables in Pine are declared with the special symbol ``=`` and an optional ``var`` keyword
in one of the following ways:

.. code-block:: text

    <identifier> = <expression>
    <type> <identifier> = <expression>
    var <identifier> = <expression>
    var <type> <identifier> = <expression>

``<identifier>`` is the name of the declared variable, see :doc:`Identifiers`.

``<type>`` can be one of the predefined keywords: ``float``, ``int``, ``bool``, ``color``, ``string``, ``line`` or ``label``.
However, in most cases, an explicit type declaration is redundant because type is automatically inferred from the ``<expression>``
on the right of the ``=`` at compile time, so the decision to use them is often a matter of preference. For example::

    baseLine0 = na          // compile time error!
    float baseLine1 = na    // OK
    baseLine2 = float(na)   // OK

In the first line of the example, the compiler cannot determine the type of the ``baseLine0`` variable because ``na`` is a generic value of no particular type. The declaration of the ``baseLine1`` variable is correct because its ``float`` type is declared explicitly.
The declaration of the ``baseLine2`` variable is also correct because its type can be derived from the expression ``float(na)``, which is an explicit cast of ``na`` value to ``float`` type. The declarations of ``baseLine1`` and ``baseLine2`` are equivalent.

The ``var`` keyword is a special modifier that instructs the compiler to *create and initialize the variable only once*. This behavior is very useful in cases where a variable's value must persist through the iterations of a script across successive bars. For example, suppose we'd like to count the number of green bars on the chart::

    //@version=4
    study("Green Bars Count")
    var count = 0
    isGreen = close >= open
    if isGreen
        count := count + 1
    plot(count)

.. image:: images/GreenBarsCount.png

Without the ``var`` modifier, variable ``count`` would be reset to zero (thus losing it's value) every time a new bar update triggered a script recalculation.

In Pine v3 the study "Green Bars Count" could be written without using the ``var`` keyword::

    //@version=3
    study("Green Bars Count")
    count = 0                       // These two lines could be replaced in v4
    count := nz(count[1], count)    // with 'var count = 0'
    isGreen = close >= open
    if isGreen
        count := count + 1
    plot(count)

The v4 code is more readable and can be more efficient if, for example, the ``count`` variable is
initialized with an expensive function call instead of ``0``.

Examples of simple variable declarations::

    src = close
    len = 10
    ma = sma(src, len) + high

Examples with type modifiers and var keyword::

    float f = 10            // NOTE: while the expression is of type int, the variable is float
    i = int(close)          // NOTE: explicit cast of float expression close to type int
    r = round(close)        // NOTE: round() and int() are different... int() simply throws fractional part away
    var hl = high - low

Example, illustrating the effect of ``var`` keyword::

    // Creates a new label object on every bar:
    label lb = label.new(bar_index, close, title="Hello, World!")

    // Creates a label object only on the first bar in history:
    var label lb = label.new(bar_index, close, title="Hello, World!")


.. _variable_assignment:

Variable assignment
-------------------

A mutable variable is a variable which can be given a new value.
The operator ``:=`` must be used to give a new value to a variable.
A variable must be declared before you can assign a value to it
(see declaration of variables :ref:`above<variable_declaration>`).

The type of a variable is identified at declaration time. From then on, a variable can
be given a value of expression only if both the expression and the
variable belong to the same type, otherwise a
compilation error will occur.

Variable assignment example::

    //@version=4
    study("My Script")
    price = close
    if hl2 > price
        price := hl2
    plot(price)

.. _if_statement:

if statement
------------

An ``if`` statement defines a block of statements to be executed when
the ``if``'s conditional expression evaluates to ``true``, and optionally,
an alternative block to be executed when the expression is ``false``.

General code form:

.. code-block:: text

    <var_declarationX> = if <condition>
        <var_decl_then0>
        <var_decl_then1>
        ...
        <var_decl_thenN>
        <return_expression_then>
    else
        <var_decl_else0>
        <var_decl_else1>
        ...
        <var_decl_elseN>
        <return_expression_else>

where:

-  ``var_declarationX`` --- this variable is assigned the value of the ``if``
   statement as a whole.
-  ``condition`` --- if the ``condition`` expression is true, the logic from the *then* block immediately following the ``if`` first line
   (``var_decl_then0``, ``var_decl_then1``, etc.) is used, if the
   ``condition`` is false, the logic from the *else* block
   (``var_decl_else0``, ``var_decl_else1``, etc.) is used.
-  ``return_expression_then``, ``return_expression_else`` --- the last
   expression from the *then* block or from the *else* block will
   determine the final value of the whole ``if`` statement.

The type of the returning value of the ``if`` statement is determined by the type of
``return_expression_then`` and ``return_expression_else``. Their types
must match. It is not possible to return an integer value from the *then* block
if the *else* block returns a string value.

Example::

    // This code compiles
    x = if close > open
        close
    else
        open
    // This code doesn't compile
    x = if close > open
        close
    else
        "open"

It is possible to omit the *else* block. In this case, if the ``condition``
is false, an *empty* value (``na``, or ``false``, or ``""``) will be assigned to the
``var_declarationX`` variable.

Example::

    x = if close > open
        close
    // If current close > current open, then x = close.
    // Otherwise the x = na.

The *then* and *else* blocks are shifted by 4 spaces [#tabs]_. ``if`` statements can
be nested by adding 4 more spaces::

    x = if close > open
        b = if close > close[1]
            close
        else
            close[1]
        b
    else
        open

It is possible and quite frequent to ignore the resulting value of an ``if`` statement
(``var_declarationX =`` can be omited). This form is used when you need the
side effect of the expression, for example in :doc:`strategy trading</essential/Strategies>`:

::

    if (crossover(source, lower))
        strategy.entry("BBandLE", strategy.long, stop=lower,
                       oca_name="BollingerBands",
                       oca_type=strategy.oca.cancel, comment="BBandLE")
    else
        strategy.cancel(id="BBandLE")

.. _for_statement:

for statement
-------------

The ``for`` statement allows to execute a number of instructions repeatedly:

.. code-block:: text

    <var_declarationX> = for <i> = <from> to <to> by <step>
        <var_decl0>
        <var_decl1>
        ...
        continue
        ...
        break
        ...
        <var_declN>
        <return_expression>

where:

-  ``i`` --- a loop counter variable.
-  ``from`` --- start value of the counter.
-  ``to`` --- end value of the counter. When the counter becomes greater
   than ``to`` (or less than ``to`` in the case where ``from > to``) the
   loop is stopped.
-  ``step`` --- loop step. Optional. Default is 1. If
   ``from`` is greater than ``to``, the loop step will automatically change direction; no need to use a negative step.
-  ``var_decl0``, ... ``var_declN``, ``return_expression`` --- body of the loop. It
   must be indented by 4 spaces [#tabs]_.
-  ``return_expression`` --- returning value. When a loop is finished or
   broken, the returning value is assigned to ``var_declarationX``.
-  ``continue`` --- a keyword. Can only be used in loops. It jumps to the loop's
   next iteration.
-  ``break`` --- a keyword. Can be used only in loops. It exits the loop.

``for`` loop example:

::

    //@version=4
    study("For loop")
    my_sma(price, length) =>
        sum = price
        for i = 1 to length-1
            sum := sum + price[i]
        sum / length
    plot(my_sma(close,14))

Variable ``sum`` is a :ref:`mutable variable <variable_assignment>` so a
new value can be given to it by the operator ``:=`` in the loop's body.
Note that we recommend using the built-in
`sma <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_sma>`__
function for simple moving averages, as it calculates faster.
