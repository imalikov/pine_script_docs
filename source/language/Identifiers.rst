Identifiers
===========

Identifiers are names used for user-defined variables and functions.
They can be composed of:

-  upper (``A-Z``) or lower (``a-z``) case letters,
-  underscore (``_``),
-  digits (``0-9``).

An identifier cannot begin with a digit.
Identifiers are case-sensitive.
Here are some examples of valid identifiers::

    myVar
    _myVar
    my123Var
    MAX_LEN
    max_len
