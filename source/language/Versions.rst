Versions
--------

There are currently four versions of the Pine Script Language. A compiler
directive must be used in the first line of a script to specify the version or Pine
used by the script: ``//@version=N`` where ``N`` is the version number (1--4). Note that
different Pine Script Language versions are incompatible with each other.

Notable changes to the language are documented in :doc:`/Release_notes`.
